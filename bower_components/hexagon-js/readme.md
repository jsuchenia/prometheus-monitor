About
-----

Hexagon.js is a collection of components, styles and JavaScript utilities. It has been designed from the ground up to support custom theming and extension and exposes a simple api for doing so.

This readme includes no details about how to use the library itself as there is extensive documentation for the library available here: [https://www.hexagonjs.io](https://www.hexagonjs.io).

This repository contains the code for the library itself which can be found in the modules folder, and some code for building the library - found in the build folder. This repository is also a node module, which makes it possible to create custom builds of hexagon, allowing inclusion of just the modules you need. The node module also exposes a way to create custom themes for hexagon and share themes in a way that allows them to be extended.
